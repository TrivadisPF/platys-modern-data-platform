Add scripts which should be executed upon initialisation of the MongoDB database. When a container is started for the first time it will execute files with extensions .sh and .js that are found in this folder. 

Files will be executed in alphabetical order. .js files will be executed by mongosh using the database specified by the MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE variable, if it is present, or test otherwise. You may also switch databases within the .js script.
