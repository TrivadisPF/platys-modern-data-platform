# `modern-data-platform` - Configuration v1.13.0

This is the documentation of the configuration settings which can be overwritten using a custom YAML file. All the defaults are defined in [`../modern-data-platform-stack/generator-config/vars/config.yml`](../modern-data-platform-stack/generator-config/vars/config.yml).

## Overall Settings

There are some overall settings which will control the behaviour for all or a group of services. These are listed in the table below.

| Config                                         	| Default 	| Since 	| Description                                                                                                                                                                        	                    	|
|------------------------------------------------	|:-------:	|-------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `use_timezone`                             	|  	| 1.5.0 | The timezone to use for the whole stack. By default is empty so the timezone of the docker engine is not changed and it will run as `Etc/UTC`. If you want to set it to another timezone, then specify a Unix timezone string, such as `Europe/Zurich` or `America/New_York`. An overview on the valid timezones can be found here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones> |  
| `private_docker_repository_name`                             	| `trivadis` 	| 1.5.0 | Docker images not available on public Docker Hub will be retrieved using this private repository. By default it points to `trivadis` and you have to login first, before you can use the generated stack, if you have selected a private image. Use this config to point to your own private docker registry if needed. |  
| `uid`                             	| `1000` 	| 1.9.0 | The UID to use when using the "user" property in a service to override the user inside the container. |  

## External Services

There are some overall settings which will control the behaviour for all or a group of services. These are listed in the table below.

| Config                                         	| Default 	| Since 	| Description                                                                                                                                                                        	                    	|

| `KAFKA_password`                             	| `` 	| 1.9.0 | Password to authenticate against the external Kafka cluster |  
| `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_enable`                             	| `false` 	| 1.9.0 |  Use an external schema registry |  
| `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_url`                             	| `` 	| 1.9.0 | The URL of the external schema registry |  
| `S3_enable`                             	| `false` | 1.9.0 | Use external S3 service, such as AWS S3 cloud service or an on-premises S3 appliance. You have to configure two environment variables, `PLATYS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY` with the access key and `PLATYS_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the access secret. This can be done on the on the docker host or in the `.env` file in the platform home (same folder where the `docker-compose.yml` is located). |  
| `S3_endpoint`                             	| `` | 1.9.0 | The endpoint address of the S3 external service |  
| `S3_path_style_access`                             	| `false` | 1.9.0 | Use Path Style Access if set to `true`, otherwise the default of virtual hosted-style access is used. | 


## Platform Service

The configuration settings for enabling/disabling a given service are named `XXXXX_enable` where XXXXX is the name of the service (he used to be named `XXXXX_enabled` in version 1.0.0).
For each service there might be some other settings, such as controlling the number of nodes to start the service with, whether the service should map a data volume into the container or controlling some other proprietary configuration properties of the service itself.
