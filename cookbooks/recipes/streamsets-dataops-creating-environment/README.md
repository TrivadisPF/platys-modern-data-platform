# Creating a self-managed StreamSets DataOps Environment using Platys

This recipe will show how to create a self-managed environment for the [StreamSets DataOps Platform](https://streamsets.com/products/dataops-platform/). 

## Signup for StreamSets DataPlatform 

Navigate to <https://cloud.login.streamsets.com/signup> and create an account as shown in the diagram.

and you will get to the StreamSets DataOps homepage

## Create a StreamSets Data Collector deployment

In the navigator to the left, click on **Set Up** and navigate to the **Environments** item. You should see a default Self-Managed environment **Default Self-Managed Environment**. We will use this and next create a deployment. 

Navigate to **Deployments** and click on the **Create deployment** link in the main canvas.

Scroll down and click on **Save & Next**.

On the next step, click on the link **3 stage libraries selected**

to configure additional libraries to be installed. On the rigtht side, the installed stage libraries are shown, on the left side, the available stage libraries can be found. Install a library by clicking on the **+** icon.

Once you are finished, click on **OK** to go back the configuration of the deployment.

Now click once again on **Save & Next**. Chose `Docker Image` for the **Install Type**.

Click on **Save & Next** and again **Save & Next** and the **Start & Generate Install Script** and you should see the script to start the docker container.

Leave the screen open, we will need the environment variables when configuring the service in `platys`.

```
docker run -d -e STREAMSETS_DEPLOYMENT_SCH_URL=https://eu01.hub.streamsets.com -e STREAMSETS_DEPLOYMENT_ID=68f53dc7-1aa7-44b8-a8e5-f73ac9da041c:14e83b51-91b3-11ec-a4ba-f369fd3f0937 -e STREAMSETS_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN=XXXXXX streamsets/datacollector:4.4.0
```

The deployment-token has been replaced, the real value will be much larger.

## Initialise data platform

Now let's [initialise a platys-supported data platform](../documentation/getting-started.md) with the following services enabled

```
platys init --enable-services STREAMSETS_DATAOPS -s trivadis/platys-modern-data-platform -w 1.14.0
```

Either add the value of `STREAMSETS_DEPLOYMENT_ID` and `STREAMSETS_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` to the `config.yml`

```
      STREAMSETS_DATAOPS_deployment_id: '68f53dc7-1aa7-44b8-a8e5-f73ac9da041c:14e83b51-91b3-11ec-a4ba-f369fd3f0937'
      STREAMSETS_DATAOPS_deployment_token: 'XXXXXX'
```

or add the environment variables to the environment, for example by using the `.env` file

```
STREAMSETS_DATAOPS_DEPLOYMENT_ID=68f53dc7-1aa7-44b8-a8e5-f73ac9da041c:14e83b51-91b3-11ec-a4ba-f369fd3f0937
STREAMSETS_DATAOPS_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN=XXXXXX
```

The URL by default is set to `https://eu01.hub.streamsets.com`. If you need another value, then specify it in the `config.yml` file using the property `STREAMSETS_DATAOPS_deployment_sch_url`.

## Check the status in Streamsets DataOps Platform

In StreamSets DataOps Platform screen, click on **Check Engine Status after runing the script**, if you have not done it yet. 

![](images/new-deployment-4.png)

Now generate and start the platform

```bash
export DATAPLATFORM_HOME=${PWD}

platys gen

docker-compose up -d
```

In StreamSets DataOps Platform after a while you should get the following confirmation message.

![](images/new-deployment-5.png)

The engine running in docker has successfully connected to the StreamSets DataOps Platform. Click on **Close**.

The environment is ready to be used.
