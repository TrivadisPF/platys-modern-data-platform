# `modern-data-platform` - Configuration v1.9.0

This is the documentation of the configuration settings which can be overwritten using a custom YAML file. All the defaults are defined in [`generator-config/vars/default-values.yml`](generator-config/vars/config.yml).

## Overall Settings

There are some overall settings which will control the behaviour for all or a group of services. These are listed in the table below.

| Config                                         	| Default 	| Since 	| Description                                                                                                                                                                        	                    	|
|------------------------------------------------	|:-------:	|-------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `use_timezone`                             	|  	| 1.5.0 | The timezone to use for the whole stack. By default is empty so the timezone of the docker engine is not changed and it will run as `Etc/UTC`. If you want to set it to another timezone, then specify a Unix timezone string, such as `Europe/Zurich` or `America/New_York`. An overview on the valid timezones can be found here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones> |  
| `private_docker_repository_name`                             	| `trivadis` 	| 1.5.0 | Docker images not available on public Docker Hub will be retrieved using this private repository. By default it points to `trivadis` and you have to login first, before you can use the generated stack, if you have selected a private image. Use this config to point to your own private docker registry if needed. |  

## Service Specific

The configuration settings for enabling/disabling a given service are named `XXXXX_enable` where XXXXX is the name of the service (he used to be named `XXXXX_enabled` in version 1.0.0).
For each service there might be some other settings, such as controlling the number of nodes to start the service with, whether the service should map a data volume into the container or controlling some other proprietary configuration properties of the service itself.
