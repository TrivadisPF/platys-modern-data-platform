# Installing `platys`

You can currenty install `platys` on macOS and 64-bit Linux only, but we are working on a plaform-independent version, to be released with the final 1.2.0 version.

## Prerequisites

`platys` relies on the Docker Engine for most of its work, so make sure you have Docker Engine installed either locally or remote, depending on your setup.
