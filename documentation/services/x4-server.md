X4 BPMS as a central digitization platform allows you to digitize your business processes on a business and technical level. Connect people, systems and devices and thus eliminate manual processes and media breaks! Due to the low-code principle, users can use the X4 BPMS to independently digitize processes without deeper programming knowledge.
