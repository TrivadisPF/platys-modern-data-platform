# Spring Boot Admin

Spring Boot Admin is a monitoring tool that aims to visualize information provided by Spring Boot Actuators in a nice and accessible way. 
This is the deployment of the Spring Boot Admin server that provides a user interface to display and interact with Spring Boot Actuators (using spring boot admin client to allow to access the actuator endpoints).
