Use the `MEMGRAPH_edition` setting to choose if you want to use the Memgraph database (with or without Mage) or the Memgraph-Platform including the Memgraph Labe environment.

```
platys gen
```


## How to use it?

Navigate to <http://dataplatform:28288> if you have the Memgraph-Platform enabled.

You can also download and install [Memgraph Lab](https://memgraph.com/lab) and [mgconsole](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph/mgconsole) ([download here](https://memgraph.com/download#memgraph-lab)) to your local machine and connect to the Memgraph instance running on the Platys stack.
