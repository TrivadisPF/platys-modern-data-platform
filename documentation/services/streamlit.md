## How to enable?

```
platys init --enable-services STREAMLIT
platys gen
```

## How to use it?

Navigate to <http://dataplatform:28340>. 

By default the `HelloWorld` Streamlit application is used which is available in `./scripts/streamlit/apps/hello-world/hello-world.py`. Just create your application by adding a new folder to the `./scripts/streamlit/apps` and place the python code there. 

Then configure platys to pick it up my changing the `config.yml` file to

```yaml
      STREAMLIT_enable: true
      STREAMLIT_image: 'python'
      STREAMLIT_artefacts_folder: './scripts/streamlit/apps'
      STREAMLIT_apps: 'my-app/my-app.py'
      STREAMLIT_apps_description: 'My Streamlit App'
```
