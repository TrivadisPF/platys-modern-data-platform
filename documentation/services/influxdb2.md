# InfluxDB v2

InfluxDB is an open source time series database. It has everything you need from a time series platform in a single binary â€“ a multi-tenanted time series database, UI and dashboarding tools, background processing and monitoring agent. All this makes deployment and setup a breeze and easier to secure.
